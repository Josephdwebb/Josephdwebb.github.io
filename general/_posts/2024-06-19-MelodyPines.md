## Overview

This summer, I had the rewarding experience of working as an EMT/Camp Nurse at Melody Pines, overseeing the health and safety of campers from kindergarten to 8th grade. Ensuring the well-being of the children was my top priority, and I was dedicated to providing excellent care and support throughout their camp adventures.

One of the highlights of my role was leading "Joe Snow's Ice Emporium," a playful ice dispensary that brought joy and relief on extra hot days. It was a delight to see the campers' faces light up as they enjoyed the refreshing treats. This seasonal job not only allowed me to apply my medical skills in a dynamic environment but also to connect with the campers and contribute to their memorable summer experiences.
