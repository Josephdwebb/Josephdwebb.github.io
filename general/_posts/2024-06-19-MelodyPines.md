## Overview

This summer, I had the rewarding experience of working as an EMT/Camp Nurse at Melody Pines, overseeing the health and safety of campers from kindergarten to 8th grade. Ensuring the well-being of the children was my top priority, and I was dedicated to providing excellent care and support throughout their camp adventures.

One of the highlights of my role was leading "Joe Snow's Ice Emporium," an imaginary ice dispensary that brought joy and relief on extra hot days. It was a delight to see the campers' faces light up as they enjoyed the refreshing treats. This seasonal job not only allowed me to apply my medical skills in a dynamic environment but also to connect with the campers and contribute to their memorable summer experiences.

## Wildlife Experience

I am grateful to the Wildlife Encounters Ecology & Wellness Center for paying a visit to Melody Pines to educate the youth campers on local animals. I was honored to have been chosen to assist in the presentation and look forward to them returning in the future.
