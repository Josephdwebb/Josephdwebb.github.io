# Field Notes from the Wildlife Pathogen Survey Team

Field Notes from the Wildlife Pathogen Survey Team

## Overview
As an Honors Undergraduate Researcher at the University of Vermont Wildlife Pathogen Lab, I have had a fulfilling opportunity to join various survey expeditions. Working across diverse sites in Vermont and New Hampshire, I've had the privilege of witnessing the intricacies of wildlife ecosystems firsthand. Surveys and tick collections have become routine , each outing revealing unique challenges and providing valuable insights into the relationship between ticks and ecological coonditions. These experiences have not only enhanved my scientific skills but have also deepened my appreciation for the delicate balance within these natural environments. As a team member, the collaborative efforts and shared dedication to wildlife research have fostered a sense of purpose in contributing to a greater understanding of our local ecosystems. These moments in the field have not only shaped my professional development but have also strengthened my commitment to the conservation of these invaluable natural habitats.


## Northern Vermont

Being a part of the survey team was an enriching experience that took me to various locations in Northern Vermont. From traversing agricultural farmland to surveying along river-adjacent trails and exploring secluded snowmobile trails, each trip brought forth unique insights. Together, we collected over 200 ticks in the field, and subsequently performed a PCR analysis of all specimen returned to the lab. The process, while rigorous, underscored the significance of our work and the dedication of our team in understanding the dynamics of tick populations in these diverse environments.

## Northern New Hampshire
```yml

  #srcset:
  #  1920w: /assets/img/projects/hyde-v2.jpg
  #  960w:  /assets/img/projects/hyde-v2@0,5x.jpg
  #  480w:  /assets/img/projects/hyde-v2@0,25x.jpg
```

Embarking on survey expeditions around the White Mountains and the base of Mount Washington, I focused on exploring less dense forests in search of [*Ixodes scapularis*](#definitions). These excursions offered a unique perspective on tick prevalence in varying environments, contributing valuable data to our ongoing research.

## Sourthern New Hampshire
```yml

  #srcset:
  #  1920w: /assets/img/projects/hyde-v2.jpg

  #  480w:  /assets/img/projects/hyde-v2@0,25x.jpg
```
Serving as the sole surveyor for sites in Southern New Hampshire, I gathered  over 500 ticks â€” both [*Ixodes scapularis*](#definitions) and [*Dermacentor variabilis*](#definitions). These specimens have been diligently returned to the lab for in-depth analysis.

## Northern Massachusetts
```yml

  path:    /assets/img/blog/fieldnotes5.png
  #srcset:
  #  1920w: /assets/img/projects/hyde-v2.jpg

  #  480w:  /assets/img/projects/hyde-v2@0,25x.jpg
```
As part of my survey of massachusetts, I collected 50 [*Ixodes scapularis*](#definitions) and near 100 [*Dermacentor variabilis*](#definitions) (shown above), but I also found a [*Amblyomma americanum*](#definitions), which was the highlight of my trip.

## Definitions
Ixodes scapularis
: Black Legged Deer Tick

Dermacentor variabilis
: American Dog Tick

Amblyomma americanum
: Lone Star Tick
