## Overview
I am honored to have participated in the UVM Student Research Conference, where I had the privilege of presenting my research alongside the talented students of the University of Vermont. Sharing this monumental occasion with friends and colleagues, including Olivia Biasetti, was truly special. The conference provided an invaluable platform to showcase our hard work, exchange ideas, and celebrate our collective achievements. It was a remarkable experience to contribute to and be part of such a vibrant academic community.
