## The Wonders of Small Mammal Specimen Preparation
On a crisp winter evening, I had the privilege of participating in a captivating Small Mammal Specimen Preparation session. The purpose was to stimulate the heart, liver, and lung tissues and meticulously preserve the skulls of roadkill specimens for inclusion in the UVM Specimen Collection. Following a thorough and engaging lesson, volunteers were given the opportunity to conduct their own specimen preparation. Despite a setback when it was discovered that the skulls were shattered, rendering the work unsafe, Lauren continued to lead an enlightening evening. The members of the UVM Wildlife Pathogens Lab joined forces to collaboratively prepare a *microtus*, making it a truly informative experience.

## Recap and Aknowledgement
I want to express my sincere appreciation to the University of Vermont Wildlife Pathogens Lab, and I extend special thanks to Lauren Berkley for their invaluable contribution in facilitating an enriching experience for me to delve into the intricacies of small mammal specimen preparation. Despite encountering unexpected challenges and experiencing genuine moments of celebration, the evening proved to be an exceptionally enlightening event. I am genuinely thankful for the dedication and effort that everyone invested in making it a memorable and educational occasion.
