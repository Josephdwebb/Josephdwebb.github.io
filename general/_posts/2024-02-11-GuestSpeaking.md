## Overview
I was deeply honored to be chosen as one of the five Guest Speakers for the University of Vermont's College of Arts and Sciences. My narrative, rooted in humility, afforded me the privilege of engaging with esteemed members of the UVM community, including Dr. Paul Deslandes, Professor and Associate Dean for Student Success. The ceremony was followed by an inspiring opportunity to connect with many admitted students, whose enthusiasm and eagerness for personal growth mirrored my own experiences as a freshman. This engagement was not only a reflection on my journey but also a celebration of the potential within each new member of the UVM family.
