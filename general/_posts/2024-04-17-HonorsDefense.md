## Overview
I am delighted to announce the successful defense of my undergraduate thesis, "Evaluating the Impact of Climatic Factors on Tick-Borne Pathogen Prevalence: Insights from Ixodes scapularis and its Borrelia burgdorferi, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, and Babesia microti Pathogens." The committee, comprising Dr. Ellen Martinsen, Dr. Nicholas Gotelli, and Dr. Gary Ward, expressed great enthusiasm for my work, awarding me the prestigious grade of A+.

The defense took place in the distinguished Memorial Hall, where friends, colleagues, and family gathered to support me. During the event, I narrated my scientific journey, introduced the scope of my research, and defended my proposed ecological model. This achievement represents the culmination of two years of dedicated work and signifies a significant milestone in my academic and professional development.
